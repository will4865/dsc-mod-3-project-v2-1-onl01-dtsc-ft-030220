# Module 3 Final Project: Customer Churn with Telco Data Set


For this project I will be predicting Customer Churn using the Telco Customer Churn Data Set. This data set is available through Kaggle and also in this repo.

Churn is defined as the percentage of customers who's business you lost during a set period of time. It can be calculated by dividing the amount of customers lost by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of this time frame.

If you were trying to calculate churn for this data set, the churn percentage can be said to be 26.6% for this time frame. As no dates are available in this data set, we cannot say what time frame this churn rate occured over.

<b>The goal of this project is to identify the most predictive features that lead customers to churn and provide business recommendations for how to reduce the number of customers who churn. <b>
